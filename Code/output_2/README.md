# Vulnerable C Code Snippets and Code Review

This repository contains several Java code snippets labeled with CWE flags, 
indicating the security vulnerabilities present in the code. Below each snippet, you 
can find a detailed code review of each code snippet generated using 
`gpt-3.5-turbo` engine.

# System Roles

To strength the performance of the GPT model, two system roles 
were used during the code review process:

1. "Helpful Assistant with Analyzing Java Code Snippets"
As a helpful assistant with analyzing C code snippets, the GPT-3.5-turbo 
engine thoroughly analyzed each code snippet for syntax errors, logical 
errors, and other issues. The review process included analyzing the code 
structure, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and suggesting 
improvements to mitigate security risks.

2. "Helpful Assistant that Detects Security Vulnerabilities"
As a helpful assistant that detects security vulnerabilities, the 
GPT-3.5-turbo engine closely examined each code snippet for potential 
security vulnerabilities. The review process included identifying vulnerabilities, such as potential buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and other 
memory-related issues that could lead to security breaches.

# Code Reviews

Each code snippet is accompanied by a detailed code review. The reviews 
include both explanation and in some cases security aspects. In some cases, they include suggestions for improving the code's security and preventing 
potential vulnerabilities from being exploited.

I encourage you to carefully review the code snippets and the 
accompanying code reviews to improve your understanding of common security 
vulnerabilities in Java programming.


# Prompt Used for Code Reviews (changed)

We changed the prompt to generate the code reviews. Now GPT focuses on security side:
`Provide a detailed code review of the following code snippet, and focus on security aspects.`


# Text Analysis

This `.numbers` document contains a Text comparison between a GPT 
generated text which reviews a vulnerable code snippet and a GPT generated 
text which reviews its fixed version. 

This analysis considers the following points: 
* Main goal: find hints in the generated texts about the CWEs of 
respective code snippets
CWE hint flag for each GPT API response with a proof column, that references the line in the `test.txt file in output_1`
* Yes: means, we found a hint to the CWE of the corresponded case. (Hit)
* No: means, we couldn't find any hints to the CWE of the corresponded case. (Miss)
Another 2 columns for other vulnerabilities with a proof column, that references the line in the `test.txt file in output_1`
* Yes: means, we found a hint to other vulnerability
* No: means, we did not find another vulnerability


* sometimes gpt generate sentences for example like: 
`There is not enough context to determine how the `xxx` method is being used in the application. Depending on how it is used, there may be security concerns elsewhere in the application.`
In this situation, we do not consider this as a hint to any vulnerability.

# Output
the output is generated as a `test.txt` as well as in a `.json` file, so 
that the output can be used again for further analysis. 
In the `gut_output.json` there is a list of dictioneries, containing the 
following keys:  
* `idx` : Index ID
* `vuln_id` : The vulnerability ID
* `desc` : A short description of the current problem
* `cwe_id`: The CWE-ID
* `repo` : Git-Repository
* `commit` : Commit 
* `code_before`: vulnerable code snippet
* `gpt_review_before`: generated code review of vulnerable code snippet
* `code_after`: fixed code snippet
* `gpt_review_after`: generated code review of fixed code snippet

Please note that the code snippets in this repository are provided for

as they are intentionally vulnerable to security weaknesses. It is the 
responsibility of the developer to ensure that their code is secure and 
free from vulnerabilities.
