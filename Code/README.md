# Content

This directory contains:

* Source Code (python script)
* Output directory
  * `test.txt`: containes the generated texts with the formated code snippets and their CWE flag
  * `gpt_output`: the generated text in a json file 
  * `result.numbers`: comparison between the generatet text of the vulnerable code and it's fixed version  
* Json dataset with vulnerable code snippets with a fixed version for each one


# Code Directory

This source code opens the json dataset and reads the
first `arg[1]` functions with their fixed version. It prints them out in an output file with
their CWE flag and with a code reviews generated by GPT-3.5 OpenAI.

# Code Execution

to run this code, please follow these steps:

1. open a terminal window and go to the directory where the code exists.
2. type this command: `python source_code.py 50`
3. the output will be generated in the directory with the path you provided in the code.

make sure to change the 3 paths in the code:
* `json_file = dataset.json`
* `output_file = test.txt`
* `gpt_json_file = gpt_output.json`
